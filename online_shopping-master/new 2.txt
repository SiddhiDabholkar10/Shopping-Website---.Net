1.when retailer registers on portal

is_accepted   is_rejected
false			false


so admin can only see retailers whose is_accepted and is_rejected is false



2. if admin approves the retailer request

is_accepted 	is_rejected
true			false


after this, retailer can add the products 
and admin wont see a pending request by this retailer


3. if admin rejected the retailers request

is_accepted 	is_rejected
false				true

after this, admin wont see the pending request also retailer cant add the products
